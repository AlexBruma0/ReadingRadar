# ReadingRadar

## Description

Welcome to my full stack web app designed for book enthusiasts! This app offers a modern twist on book tracking, similar to Goodreads.

The home page serves as a central hub where users can easily manage their books. They can organize them into categories like 'To Be Read,' 'Reading,' and 'Read,' or create custom categories to suit their needs. Users can drag and drop books between categories for seamless organization.

Clicking on a book opens its dedicated page, where owners can edit details such as title, author, and notes. This page also allows for user interaction, with the ability for other users to leave comments and engage in discussions about the book.

To explore other users' libraries, simply navigate to the sidebar and click on the 'Users' tab. Here, you can browse through registered users and view the books they've added. Users can also leave comments on other users' books, fostering a sense of community among readers.

Additional features include a color theme switcher in the settings, allowing users to personalize their experience. There's also a convenient grid view for each category, complete with filtering and sorting options, making it easy to find and organize books to your liking.
